An **AXI VIP (Verification IP)** is a specialized verification component used to validate **AXI (Advanced eXtensible Interface)** protocols within a simulation environment. AXI VIP simplifies and accelerates the process of verifying AXI-based designs by providing a configurable and reusable module that mimics or checks AXI bus behavior.

### Key Features:
1. **Protocol Compliance**  
   - Ensures adherence to AXI specifications (AXI3, AXI4, AXI4-Lite).  
   - Detects protocol violations through built-in checkers.

2. **Master, Slave, and Monitor Agents**  
   - **Master Agent**: Generates AXI transactions such as read/write bursts.  
   - **Slave Agent**: Responds to transactions initiated by a master.  
   - **Monitor Agent**: Passively observes AXI traffic to capture and analyze transactions.

3. **Configurable Parameters**  
   - Supports user-defined **data width, address width, and ID width**.  
   - Customizable to simulate various AXI configurations (e.g., AXI4-Lite for control paths or AXI4 for high-speed data transfers).

4. **Functional Coverage**  
   - Provides coverage collection capabilities to track protocol features exercised during simulation.  
   - Assists in achieving comprehensive verification.

5. **Assertions and Scoreboarding**  
   - Includes built-in **assertions** to ensure correct protocol execution.  
   - Implements **scoreboarding** for result comparison between expected and actual outputs.

6. **Testbench Integration**  
   - Seamlessly integrates into SystemVerilog-UVM (Universal Verification Methodology) environments.  
   - Supports randomized stimulus generation for exhaustive testing.

7. **Debug and Logging**  
   - Generates detailed logs for AXI transactions, timing information, and protocol violations.  
   - Simplifies debugging through waveform visualization.
